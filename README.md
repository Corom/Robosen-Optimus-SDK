# Robosen-Optimus-SDK
Unofficial .NET SDK for the [Robosen Optimus Prime](https://robosen.com/transformersoptimusprime) transforming robot

This is a .net 6 cross platform sdk that implements the Bluetooth protocol that I have reverse engineered.
This should allow you to use all the same functionality exposed in their app, but use at your own risk.
