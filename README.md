# Robosen-Optimus-SDK
Unofficial .NET SDK for the [Robosen Optimus Prime](https://robosen.com/transformersoptimusprime) transforming robot

This is a .net 6 cross platform sdk that implements the Bluetooth protocol that I have reverse engineered.
This is a work in progress and in not sponsored in any way by Robosen, so use at your own risk.  
I am adding new capability as I discover it, but I eventually I expect this to support all the same capabilities as the Robosen Optimus Prime App.

While the code should run on Linux, Android, Mac, IOS, and Windows, I have currently only tested this on windows 11.
